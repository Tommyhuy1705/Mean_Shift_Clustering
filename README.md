# **Mean_Shift_Clustering**

## Introduction  

Mean Shift Clustering is a density-based unsupervised learning algorithm that groups data points by shifting them toward regions of higher density. Unlike k-means, it does not require specifying the number of clusters beforehand, making it useful for identifying arbitrary cluster shapes.
The algorithm iteratively moves data points to the mean of nearby points within a defined bandwidth, converging to dense regions in the feature space. The choice of bandwidth significantly impacts clustering performance.
Mean Shift is widely used in image segmentation, object tracking, and anomaly detection. Despite its flexibility, its computational cost can be high for large datasets. This study explores its theoretical foundations, implementation, and optimization techniques.

## **Features**
- **Density-Based Approach**: Finds clusters based on high-density regions without assuming a specific number of clusters.
- **Adaptive Cluster Shape**: Identifies arbitrarily shaped clusters, unlike k-means which assumes spherical clusters.
- **Bandwidth Sensitivity**: The choice of bandwidth affects the clustering outcome, influencing the number and shape of clusters.
- **Non-Parametric**: Does not require prior knowledge about the data distribution or the number of clusters.
- **Robust to Noise**: Can handle outliers better than some other clustering methods.
- **High Computational Cost**: Computationally expensive for large datasets due to its iterative nature.
