# Mean_Shift_Clustering
This research explores Mean Shift Clustering, a non-parametric algorithm that identifies clusters without preset numbers using kernel density estimation. Applied in image segmentation, object tracking, and anomaly detection, it is compared with K-Means and DBSCAN, with proposed optimizations to improve efficiency.
